OpenSesame
==========
OpenSesame is an open source password management tool designed to be secure and
easy to use. The fewer key strokes the better. OpenSesame uses GNOME-keyring to
store and retrieve generated passwords. To retrieve a password you only need to 
remember the name the password was stored as. For example, run OpenSesame and
enter 'twitter' to place your twitter password into the cntl-v paste buffer.
