OpenSesame
==========
OpenSesame is an open source password management tool designed to be secure and
easy to use. The less key strokes the better. OpenSesame uses GNOME-keyring to
store and retrieve generated passwords. Passwords are generated using APG 
(Automated Password Generator) so that the passwords are easy to remember. To
retrieve a password you only need to remember the name the password was stored
as. For example, run OpenSesame and enter 'twitter' to place your twitter pass-
word into the cntl-v paste buffer.
